# Assignment 1 - Code Refactoring
In this assignment I attempted to improve the html (and css) files to meet the acceptance criteria outlined below. 

#### User Story (Obtained from the assignment description)
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

#### Acceptance Criteria (Obtained from the assignment description)
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
